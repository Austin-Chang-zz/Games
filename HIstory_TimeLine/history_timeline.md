Create an interactive historical timeline component that engages students. Start with an example “Ancient Civilizations” timeline (3000 BCE-500 CE) featuring Egyptian, Greek, and Roman key events with expandable information cards and a cohesive visual style.As a follow up ask me about: specific historical events/period to include, student age group, theme focus (cultural, scientific, political), visual style preferences, interactive element preferences
